## Project Description
This project emulates a Pinterest-like data pipeline to handle real-time user-generated data. The aim is to simulate the process of ingesting, processing, and storing data at scale, using AWS services and Kafka. Through this project, I've learned about the complexities of managing data pipelines in a cloud environment, the importance of data stream partitioning for scalability and fault tolerance, and the intricacies of configuring AWS services and Kafka for real-time data processing.

## Installation Instructions
(TODO: Provide detailed steps on setting up the project, including necessary AWS configurations, software installations, and environment setups.)

## Usage Instructions
(TODO: Include instructions on how to use the system once it's set up, detailing any commands, scripts, or interfaces designed for interacting with the pipeline.)

## File Structure
(TODO: Detail the organization of the project directory, explaining the purpose of main folders and files to help users navigate your project.)
